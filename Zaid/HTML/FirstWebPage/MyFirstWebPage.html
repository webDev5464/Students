    <p> Please don't skip this 1-minute read. We're sorry to interrupt, but our fundraiser won’t last long. <br><br> This Saturday, 2 September, our nonprofit humbly requests your support. Wikipedia was one of the first spaces online where you could learn for free, without   ads. Just 2% of our readers donate, so whatever amount you can contribute helps, whether it’s         ₹ 25 or ₹ 1,000. — The Wikimedia Foundation, host of Wikipedia and its sister sites. </P>
