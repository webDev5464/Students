<p>
In the realm where clouds convene,
A symphony of gray and serene,
Comes a dance from the heavens above,
As raindrops descend, a gift of love.

Upon my face, they gently land,
Like nature's kisses, soft and grand,
Each droplet, a bead of liquid grace,
Caressing my skin with a tender embrace.

The pitter-patter on rooftops and leaves,
A rhythmic melody that the rain weaves,
It whispers secrets to the earth below,
A language only nature's soul can know.
